# Based on Mantis Free React Material UI Dashboard Template

Interested in creating a react website of your own "from scratch?" Dear Climate, With Love is based on the Javascript version of Mantis Free React Material UI Dashboard Template

Mantis is a free and open source React redux dashboard template made using the Material UI React component library with aim of flexibility and better customizability.

### Name Derived From Nature

Mantis Logo is inspired from the insect name - 'Mantises' as they have triangular heads with flexible Necks. Also, the name is derived from two popular UI frameworks, Material UI and Ant Design (M-Ant-is).

Mantis has Ant Design principal on top of the MAterial UI React component library.
